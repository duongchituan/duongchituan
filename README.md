## 👋 About Me

A data-driven individual with a background in Information Technology, currently transitioning into Data Analytics.
My IT experience builds a strong foundation in logical thinking, working with complex systems, and quickly adapting
to tools like SQL, Python, and Power BI. Drawn by the impact of data on decision-making, I’ve actively upskilled
through real-world projects to turn data into actionable insights, and now seek to grow further in a data-focused
environment where I can deliver business value.
